Summary:
A visualization of student emotion and performance in learning Mathematics at country level. Students perform better when they feel less anxious in learning Mathematics, and the anxiety level is smaller in wealthy countries. Female students, in general, feel more anxious in learning Mathematics than male students.

Design:
•	Remove all reference lines in sheets to make the sheets clearer. 
•	Remove the annotations in the sheets that contain the same information to the legends.
•	Reduce the size of Axis since they are not the focus.
•	Add the trend lines to indicate the correlations.
•	Bar plots of the relationship between the gender and the mathematics anxiety and performance are replaced by box plots since there is a large number of countries to show. 
•	A scatterplot of the difference in Maths score between male and female students and the difference in Maths Anxiety between male and female students is created to replace the scatterplot in which both male and female Maths score and anxiety level are plotted. First, there are too many points in the original plot. Second, no clear trend is observed.
•	The difference in Mathematics between the male and female students is calculated by subtracting male anxiety level from female anxiety level since in general female student has a higher anxiety level. 

Feedback:
•	How to cluster the data in the scatterplot of student Maths performance and emotional level.
•	Remove the reference lines.
•	Remove the unnecessary annotations.
•	Change the size of Axis. 
•	Add the trend lines in scatterplots.
•	Remove the bar plots.
•	Include a geographic map.
•	Consider the difference in Maths score and anxiety level between the male and female students. 
•	Change the calculation of the difference in Math anxiety between the male and female students.
