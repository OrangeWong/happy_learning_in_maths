Summary:
A visualization of student emotion and performance in learning Mathematics at country level. Students perform better when they feel less anxious in learning Mathematics, and the anxiety level is smaller in wealthy countries. Female students, in general, feel more anxious in learning Mathematics than male students.

Design:
•	I had decided to use the reference lines to represent the averages of several student’s properties across all countries. I believed the lines could help visualize the groups. However, people found the reference lines do not improve the visualization, so I removed all of them. 
•	I had added several annotations in the figure of ‘emotion-performance’ sheet to illustrate the group’s properties. But people found it is not helpful since they contain the same information to the legends.
•	In the beginning, I enlarged the size of fonts in the axes of the figures to make sure the fonts are clear. People suggested the font was already clear enough, and then I reduced the size of all fonts in the axes.
•	I did not add trend lines since the figures contained the reference lines. But after removing all reference lines, people suggested adding the trend lines to indicate the correlations.
•	I created circle views (‘gender-anxiety’, ‘gender-performance’) to indicate the relationship between the gender and the mathematics anxiety and performance since it can see the relationship of each country. People found that the overall trend would be more important than the relationship of each country. Then, I showed the same information using box plots to focus on the global trends.
•	First, I plotted both male and female maths scores and anxiety level in a scatterplot. But after discussing with people, we found that plotting the difference of maths score between male and female students and the difference of maths anxiety level between male and female students could provide more information. 
•	People found it was still difficult to understand the trend observed in the updated ‘gender-difference’ scatterplot. Therefore, I re-plotted the x-axis by subtracting male anxiety level from female anxiety level to make a positive correlation trend in the plot since female student usually has a higher anxiety level.
Feedback:
•	How to cluster the data in the scatterplot of student maths performance and emotional level.
•	Remove the reference lines.
•	Remove the unnecessary annotations.
•	Change the size of fonts in all axes. 
•	Add the trend lines in scatterplots.
•	Remove the circle view plots.
•	Include a geographic map.
•	Consider the difference in maths score and anxiety level between the male and female students. 
•	Change the calculation of the difference in math anxiety between the male and female students.
